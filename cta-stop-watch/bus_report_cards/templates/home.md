As part of the [2024 Mansueto Data Journalism Initiative](https://miurban.uchicago.edu/opportunities/local-data-journalism-initiative/), this project analyzes historic real time bus location data as collected by the [Chi Hack Night Ghost Bus](https://ghostbuses.com/) project to investigate Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) bus service since May 2022. The goal of this project was to understand how bus service changed over time in the city of Chicago after the disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic and across the city’s community areas.


As part of the analyze we have provided Bus Report Cards—an interactive platform with indicator at the community, route and bus stop level to allow riders to explore relevant metrics about the stops and routes that they use. The report cards will update monthly with up to date metrics. Explore the Report Cards here.

Reviewing the real time bus loactiosn as compared to the schedule, we found that the CTA initially opted to decrease scheduled service to match performance and then increased it, but these changes were disproportionately felt across Chicago’s community areas.
