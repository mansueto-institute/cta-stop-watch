                  >2024 Mansueto Data Journalism Initiative</a
                > — investigates Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) bus service after the COVID-19 
                pandemic disruptions. The StopWatch analyzes historic real time bus location 
                data as collected
                by <a href="https://ghostbuses.com/">Chi Hack Night Ghost Bus</a> since May 2022 to date.
                The goal was to understand how bus service changed in the city of Chicago over
                time and across the city’s community areas.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of the StopWatch, the 
                <a href="{{ url_for('report') }}">Bus Report Cards</a> — an interactive
                platform with indicators at the community, route and bus stop level x— 
                allow riders to explore relevant metrics about the stops and routes that
                they use. The report cards will update monthly with up to date metrics.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reviewing the real time bus locations as compared to the schedule, we
                found that the CTA initially opted to decrease scheduled service to match
                performance and then increased it, but these changes were
                disproportionately felt across Chicago’s community areas. Read our
