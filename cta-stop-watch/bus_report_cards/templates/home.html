      The Mansueto Institute's StopWatch tracks how bus service has changed in the city of Chicago after the COVID-19 pandemic. It includes <a href="{{ url_for('report') }}">Bus Report Cards</a>, an interactive platform that allows riders to compare bus service, including wait time and number of routes, across different neighborhoods. The key findings include: 
      </p> 
      
      <ul>
      <li>In 2023, the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) decreased scheduled service to match actual service, giving the appearance of improved bus service.</li>
      <li>At the start of 2024, the CTA increased service but these changes were disproportionately felt across Chicagoâ€™s community areas.
      </li>
      </ul>
